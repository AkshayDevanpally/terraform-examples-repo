# ============================================================================================
# âœ… Purpose:
# Create a security group within a custom VPC to allow secure SSH access to EC2 instances.
# The security group allows inbound SSH traffic from any IP and all outbound traffic.

# ðŸ§  Key Concepts:
# - Security Group: Acts as a virtual firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic
# - Ingress Rule: Controls incoming traffic (e.g., allow SSH)
# - Egress Rule: Controls outgoing traffic (e.g., allow all outbound connections)
# - Tagging: Helps identify and organize AWS resources
