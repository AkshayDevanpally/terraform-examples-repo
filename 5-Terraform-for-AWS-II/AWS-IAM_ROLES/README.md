# AWS IAM Roles, S3 Bucket, and EC2 Instance with Terraform

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project showcases how to use **Terraform** to automate the provisioning of:

- An **S3 Bucket**  
- An **IAM Role** with associated **policies**  
- An **EC2 Instance**  
- IAM Role attachment to EC2, allowing it to upload files directly to the S3 bucket

---

## ðŸ§± Description

This setup demonstrates how an EC2 instance can securely interact with an S3 bucket using IAM roles and policies instead of hardcoded credentials. Key highlights:

- Creation of a custom **IAM Role** and inline policy for S3 access  
- Provisioning of an **EC2 instance** and attaching the IAM role  
- Secure file upload from EC2 to S3 using the assigned permissions
